# Whats_cooking_CDA_Assignment
Final assignment for Classical Data Analysis - Allison, Chico and Christian


# Assignment Description

In this assignment you have to choose a Machine Learning data set, it can be from sklearn, kaggle or any place you like. The idea for this project is that you can familiarize with different data science techniques when presented with a new data set. Mainly the different methods that can be applied in order to extract information from it, either supervised or unsupervised.  You will have two deliverables for this project. 

1) The first deliverable will be a jupyter notebook. In this jupyter notebook you should present the code to download the data set, present the data set, and show different machine learning algorithms. For example, you may compare an unsupervised clustering algorithm and then a supervised classification algorithm. Or do regression and perform dimensionality reduction. To sum up, do anything that you might find interesting and is ML related. The goal is that you explore and realize that one data set can be studied in different ways. EVALUATION: In order to evaluate this notebook I will mainly look at your explanations and comments. It is important that you justify every experiment and comment on the results!! The code should be well written and work.

2) The second deliverable will be a presentation. This presentation will be on the last day of our subject and EVERYBODY will have to present. All the persons in the group should speak more or less equally, and the grade of the presentation will be individual (although probably similar within the group). The presentation should explain the data set, your experiments and results. There is no need for code in the presentation although it will be welcome if you explain something interesting about it. (Reading the code out-loud will not give you any points). I will evaluate the clarity of the slides (you will have to deliver those to me as well), the clarity when you present the results and the content of the presentation itself. Moreover, during the presentations of others you will be encouraged to ask questions and when you present you should answer them. Remember that Participation + oral presentation is 30% of the grade, therefore asking questions will be important!


# Kaggle Description

Picture yourself strolling through your local, open-air market... What do you see? What do you smell? What will you make for dinner tonight?

If you're in Northern California, you'll be walking past the inevitable bushels of leafy greens, spiked with dark purple kale and the bright pinks and yellows of chard. Across the world in South Korea, mounds of bright red kimchi greet you, while the smell of the sea draws your attention to squids squirming nearby. Indiaâ€™s market is perhaps the most colorful, awash in the rich hues and aromas of dozens of spices: turmeric, star anise, poppy seeds, and garam masala as far as the eye can see.

Some of our strongest geographic and cultural associations are tied to a region's local foods. This playground competitions asks you to predict the category of a dish's cuisine given a list of its ingredients.
